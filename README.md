Submission for the 2022 Pygame Summer Jam

1. Through the folder named "code", there you will find the game's executable.
2. In the attempt of running, Windows will warn you about a trojan virus,
that is because the executable is a packaged Python script, ignore it.
3. Once ready, simply double-click the executable file.

Notice: Make sure all files stay together under their directory. Also, upon
closing the game, you may see an error pop-up saying "quit not defined", ignore and close it.
